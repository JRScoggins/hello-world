So far it seems to be good way to keep track of a story and have an editor edit it without interfering with the writer's process.
A simple text file can do a lot as it is just limited to your imgination and avaliable information.
A cool idea would be a freindship journal where you pass it back and forth to either tell a story or learn more about each other.
